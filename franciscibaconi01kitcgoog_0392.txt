approximate, according to modern ways ol thought, to Bscon’s
conceptiones Form.

This moy be tried in two woys3 either by looking st the
distinctions he dinus between the different kinds of Form, (IL
17:26.) orbyregsrding the relstionshipinwhieh, inhis Method,
Form stands to Dotem Prooese and Latent Stercore.

(1.) We lind two divisione of Forms. First, in ΙΙ. 17. we

heve true Forms distinguished hom deputate, end lrom Plo· ’
tonic‚· t'or, Becon says, “ we must tske heed lest, in speaking

ol Forms, we should be thought to refer to those which hove ι

hitherto occupied men’s thoughts.’'

Copulate Forms he defines es “ netnrerum simplicium con-
jugis ex eursu eommrmi universi.” These seem to be results
produced by “ crossing breeds,'’ by transgressing neture's
limits3 grsltingencpple onepeerstock would perhaps be ubst
is meunt. These he promises to consider together with Latent
Process end Structure. The Platonie Forms be elso rejects3
ond this distinction is importent. Without entering et ull
into discussion ss to ubet Plato reully intended by his ἰδέω,
which would be beside our purpose, itis enough to shew ubet
conception Boeon hed of them. He cells them idco abehoctoe,
and not limited by matter: i. e. the εἴδη χωριστά, as Aristotle
termed them. (cs. De Angm. Scient. IV. iv.) Becon's Form,
then, slwsps resides in tbe matter of esch kind; end when (as
in l. 23.) he speaks ol “ divine mentis ideee,” he does not meon
to involve any notion of Archetypnl Ferme emsnoting from the
Dirine Mind; but only to affirm thet God(“ Formstnm inditor
et opifex,” 11. 15.) is the cause os, end knous the reel cod
very nature ol things, es they ere. It remeius, then, thet
Form in Beoon’s lengusge means the very ond inmost nature
of things: neither the “ Len ol Nature ’' to ulrich things ere
obedient, nor the ‘⁴ Archetypnl Forms,’' being the mmo thing:
the former is below, the letter beyond Becon’s conception.

There is still the other division left This is found ll. 26;
where he is describing “ constitutive or collective Instences.''
For these he apologises3 they ore low, ‘⁴ postulet res et intir-
mites humaui intellectus, otformc porticobsree notontm·.'’
And he afterwards cells them sormoe minores.- end from his
