antedilurian patriarch, in merely polling the votesl’ Lastly;
ifwc tahe the higher view of the term Form, his Method has
sailed to bring us nonar to the discovery of it.

Lot me add a few words on Modern Induction; the subject
is along one, but I will try ιο be brief. Its main object is the
discovery of Laws of Nature; and by these Iaws, taking the
term iu a wide sense, arc meant those general facts which ob-
servation and experiment teach us to lay down as invariable.
Thus the Law of Gravity, the Law of Batrachos, the Law of
Polarization, the Law of Actinism, these are all short state
ments os uuisorm facts, some more and some less general in
their applicatiou, hut all invariable in their action, so iar as we
know. From this we gether, that Modern induction does not
secli for Causas, as the hnciout was said todo, but is content
to obtain those ‘⁸ generahzations from expericnce” which form
the grouudworh of the Scicncea Of these general expressions
some are attainable by analysis‚ as many of those of Chcmistry
arc3 others require shrewdncss, sagacity‚ and power of iuvent·
ing Hypotbeses, which may account for the Pheuomeua. And
it is this hitting upon tbc Law to answer ιο the isolatcd facts
in our possession which distinguishcs Modern Induction from
Ancieut; audit is in this that the genius of modern times
peculiarly shows itself. Thus chler hit at last upon au Hy·
pothesis which accouutcd for the Orbit of Mars, aud the Ellip·
tioal Motion of that Plauet having once been ascertained, tho
Law was soon shown ιο bc applicabis ιο the other planeta as
well. And it was afterwards beautifully connected with the
Law of Gravity by the demonstratione of Central Foroes: a
fine instance of Bacou's “quaudo Physicum terminatur iu
Mathematico.'’

From this it will appear that the prominent conception in
Modern Induction is not that οι Method. In fact, it is notat
all clear that wc may use auy such phrase as “ tho Method of
Modern induction ;'' for itis very doubtful whether the prosc-
cution oi Modern Scicnce can ever be put under one law cr
set oi laws. Each wisc student of Nature bas sought his in·
spiratious from her, by obserwing her doiugs, and by expori-
rnsnt upon thcm; by judicious selectiou of critical instances;
