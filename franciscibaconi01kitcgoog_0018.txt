thot sooro, excellent practice l'or students; s great port of
whose edueatiou‚ it should ever be nemembered, lies in obtein-

ing the power os grssping the truths oontoined in books in the
best way, i. e. in the power ol reoding with attention ond
prolit3 by no meone one of lhe eosiest ports of eduootion. And,
thirdly, though the method os the Novum Orgenon is errone-
ous, or, ot least, inapplioable, es s whole; ports ol' it (ss, l'or

too, guesses eud suggestions, whioh heve sinoe been verified:
