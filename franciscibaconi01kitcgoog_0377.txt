The former moy bc scd, the letter is leerlirl The formeris
easily confuted by sn sppssl ιο lect, end ιο Βιοοιιί own
eernest end wise lnngnsge: the letter, es we hove scen, ctos
to hinder ns from using Becon es o witnem against it; or, os
we would rather sey, es e witness lor himsell'.

Evory seir mind must ellow thet the horden ol prool' rests
with the Positivists. Becon's lnngnoge must he proved ιο be
the seme with theirs; ior the position ιο held, end the times
he lived in, allow os no e priori presumption thot his views co·
inoidsd with theirs. It is true thet the mterislist theory ol
the Universe wee in existence: modern forms οἰ error are
usually modificatione of ancient formsz end cnr medem Mete-
rielists nro the Atomists cl the Ancionts‚ with tho modificetions
introduced by the modern Inductivo System ol investigation:
but in Bscon’s dnys it wes not en ecknowledged view, end un-
less he con be shown ιο heve held lengnsgo such es docleroe
his mind ιο heve beon moterielist, the Positivists heve nc right
whatever ιο eloim him os theirs. Το most persons those few
pesseges from his writings which I shall prosently refer ιο will
be, I think, quite conclusive egeinst this3 l'or they ehewe
worm es well es en cxnct Feith: but it will be ns well to in-
vestigete briefly the grounds on which he hes been claimed ss
cMoterielist.

hirst, then, his statements es to en Inductive methcd for the
discovery of facts in msn’s Morel Nature ere alleged, oe
showing thet hc took e moterielist view ol the iunctione ol' the
morel lile cs men, es though he held thot foclinge ere nervons

sensatione, &c Thon he speeks most fovourcbly ol' Democri· ¹

tus, end shows great partiality towards the Atheistio Philo-
sophy ol' the Ancients. Thon he speaks oi o ‘¹ commune vin-
culum enimi et corporis,’' es though mind ond body were nlilve

{lnikirpd elike material. He elso rogerds linsl &uses with
'tte ovour.

Does this not seem o nsrrow foundetion for such o structure,
even grenting the monstrous position thet we moy allow thet
Beoon's lenguege ono wey is honest, ond the other wey not?
