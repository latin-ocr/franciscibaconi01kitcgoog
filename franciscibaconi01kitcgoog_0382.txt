lbere traneoribed the passage st length; lor it includes all

tbe important points of Anoient Induction. llirst, we hnwe
the statement ol the Sylleyiem ἐξ ἐπαγωγῆς, where Aristotle
seems to draw a distinction between the process of guining
knowledge and the formal arrangement of thet knowledge.
Then he goes on to do ewsy with euch distinction by adding
οὕτω γορ ποιούμεθα τὰς ἑπογογίεε and he lays it down that
Induction is proving the connection between ‘⁴ Middle'' end
‘¹ Major’ by means ol the “ Minor :” i. e. 'nt sn ordinary Syllo
giem runs thus,
All B is A,
All C is B;
All C is A:
then Induction will run thus—
All C is A,
All O is B;
All B is A.

Now any person ordinsrily acquainted with Logicel forms will
see immediately thet this is logically incorrect3 that, in fact,
it involves an ‘⁶ Illicit process os the Minor.” Therelore itis
thet Aristotle edds Δεΐ δὲ νσεῖν τὸ Fre ἐξ ἁπάντων συγκείμενον,
in other words, the principle of Simple Enumeration (ἡ γὰρ
ἐπαγωγὴ διὸ πάντων) ἱο introduced, and the whole validity ot
the process is besed upon the assumptiones the “ convertibility
of the Minor,'' or, in English, upon the assumption tbst it is
possible to exhaust end catalogue ull ceses on any subject: tbc
τρίτον, or Minor in the Deductiwe syllogism, (which is used es
tbe middle Term in the Inductiwe) is really this enumeration
ol nll possible cases. To explain3 letus take Aristotle's own
illustration.
