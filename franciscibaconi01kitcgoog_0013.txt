these forth into the world was, apparently, to prepare men’s y
minds l'or the great work, whose object and character were so Ῑ

unlilse what was ordinarily taught in those days, that he ἶ
deemed it necessary not ιο produce it too suddenly or boldly. p

As it was, the Novum Organm was not well received at the l

first. The king made a johe on it, as johes were then went ιο
be made, rather witty and very profane; sir E. Coke made
bad rhymes against it; even sir T. Bodley censured it; people
generally seemed ιο suppose it was something ιο admira some-

of that noble mind, they also, let us hope, give all the more
hearty praise to the marvellcns excellences which it displays.
The Novum Organon was bnt a little fragment. In it,
indeed, are contained those principles and thoughts which
occupied Bacon’s mind all his lile through: and we cannot
be far wrong in considering the 1st book and the opening of
the and as the most important of all his philosophical writings.
They certainly list the veil which hangs over his conception of
the realm of knowledge, and, though it is but a description of
