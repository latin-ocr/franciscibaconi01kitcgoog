What then did Beeon propone ae asnbetitote sor thionn-
satisfactory system?

He songht ior e Mothod which might enable all nen (be
their natinal faniltiee never eo different) to attain the knev-
ledge esnethe with eqnai ease and certainty. H'a Method
aas to unfold the Fon-in, οι· real natum (Natnn naturane) oi
things to man’s geee; and enable man to apply his knowledge
to the production oi new fruit of inventione, and almost of
