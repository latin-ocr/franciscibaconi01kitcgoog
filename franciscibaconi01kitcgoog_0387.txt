necessity of negaticee, of rejection end exclusiou of all Naturae
which do net exhibit the required Nature. Pnedng by thoee
questions es very veguely auswered, if anawered at cll, ve
come ιο the doctrine of suoeeasivc steps, the most distinctive

aud satisfactory pert of Baeou's Method. For it was by point
ing oct the need ef discrimination between different orden (te
speek Mathematically) of Generaliaatiou‚ that Baccu led the

way to the construction of Modern Scieucee. By such succes-
sive stages Astronomy, Optics‚ Mechauira, have boen built up
to their present noble height; and Dr. Whewell has been a

premiuence; aud hes left us descriptione cf many attempta,
which we may smile at for their rudeness, but which, never-

1 said before, Experiment is really, as much ae one thing ean
he, the cause ef the marked succem aud progreoe of the
physical acieucee in modern times.

To sum up; Becou's induetiou is good, as it opposee the
ancient aud scholastic systems; as it introduoed regularity of
registratiou of results; as it took wider views ef the relation-
ship between the branchos of scienee3 as it discrimiueted
between the orders of generalitatiom aa it arranged those
orders; as it based iteelf upon diseeobon and interrogation of
Nature by means of Experiment His Method failed, however, ¹
