And in another place Aristotle confirma this principle ol' simple
enumeration by saying, ὅτι πᾶν οὕτως ql μηδὶν ἄλλος-ἰ. e. ‘⁸ cui
nihil occurrit in contrarium.’' Anal. Post ΙΙ. vii. r.

This is the Ancient Induction: a Syllogism in the Third
Figura with a necessary condition attached, which, snictly
speaking, takes it out ol the domain ol Logia altogether.

This is very different hom the Scholastic Induction which
Aldrich, or that which Abp. Whately have tried ιο explain

Aldrich's lndnction is“ Syllogismus cnjus Minor reticetnr”- κ
a sort of Enthymeme: and the hfinor is the assumption by the i

mind that the cases before us may stand for· all casea He ¹
thus throne Induction into Barbara ond reduces it to preciso
Logical longuage. I presumo that the meaning ol his method
oi analysis is simply this-that having gothered certain in·
succes, we observo that a certain qualityis attached to anch
of them—¹‘ Hic et istest ille magnes trahit ferrum''-and then
we assum that till the contrary is proved in any instance, this
quality may be believed ιο be present in oll cases; ie. “Omnis
magnes est hic et iste et ille: Ergo; omnis magnes trehitlerrnm.”

This is then, practically, a somewhot altered way ot' regsrd
ing Anoient Induction: bnt is still really “per enumerationem

simplicom” oi all knoem cases.
Abp. Whately holds that Induction is a Syllogism in Bar·
