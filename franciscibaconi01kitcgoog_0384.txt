bura with a suppressed Major; which Major is, ¹‘ What is true
elenchos these ceses is true of all :’' which in itself seems tn
offer no solution: for it falls under the same head with Ari-
stotle's and Aldrich's, as involving simple enumeration

Is then this “Inductio per simplicem enumerationem” a
philosophienl absurdity? By no means. Whether we accept
Locke's view that Mathematieal Axiome are so established, or
net, there ere still many things the truth ol which hos been
affirmed solely by continual observation of unverying pheno-
mena Our knowledge ol the fact thet two and two make four,
or that four end one make five, may or may not be resemble
to this principle; at any rate, the conclusione reached by the
unscientific are almost all os this kind. It is a lower sort-ol
knowledge, but it is knowledge as far as it goes. Thus the
observation οι years will teaoha sailor that the tide will ebb
and flow twice in a given day r this he is sure of without being
able to give a reason l'or it; the scientifie man will know the
sect, and its “ antecedent ; '' viz. the aetion of the Messes ol the
Moon and Suu upon the surseee efour Plenet. It faiis, however,
because itisindiseriminating, end“precnrio concludit, etperieulo
exponitur ab instantia contradictoriu.'’ (Nor. Org. Ι. 105.) Itis
indiscriminating; t'or it seems to draw no distinction between
those general propositions, which are merely statements ot' what
are called acmhlmts, and those which involve some knowledge ol
the eesmtiol Nature, or Lew of existence oia class. Thus,
Aneient Induction would treet with equnl respect the Uni-
versale, “ All crows ere bleek,'' end “ All particles attraet one
another with aforce which varies inversely as the square ol'
their distance.'' It also lecke for discriminative power, in not
discerning the difference between the most abstract “ notionnlia
Axiomnta,'' and the intermediatc generahnetions. All its ge-
nerelizations are, so to speek, supposed to lie in one plene.
For the precarious position ol its conclusione, it is enough to
remark that the mere collocation ol observed facts, and the
discovery of a formula to express their points of resemblance,
ean never give more than an imperfect certainty. There must
always be behind it the seer os a contradictory instance.
