Augmentis Scientimum”-“ Axioms or profitehle obseruatione
ss full not within the compnss of sny of the special purte of
Philosophy or Sciences, but ere more common end of c higherv
stege.” These Axioms he there collecte together, eud regende
as obesis for e “Primo Philosophiae But for ell the concerus
of humen life, the intermediete Axiorm ere looked on by him
es the wulunble ones. We might illustrate from Optics, taking
such propositione us ‘⁴ the diffrrdon of light from c luminous
body takes plnce equally in every direction’'-or “ rcys of light
ere capable of both Reflection und Refrnction” These would
be the lowest class of Axium When, by consideration of ceses,
we hed eoucluded thet these Laws ere true, then such “Anione’'
cs the following might be sturted ss e lower cluss of “ Medie-
thet “ the diffusion of light follows efixed luw.” Thon thet
thot lew is, that “ the Intensity of light varies inuersely es the
snrfece illuminated’'-·-or thet the surisce illumiueted varies ss
the distance from the luminous body. Or, to tulus the other
low Axiom, we might pass on to shew, by lnducfinn, thet “the
engle of lucideuee=the engle uf Reflection”-or, that “ Refrac·
tion takes plecc nt o fixed engle differing according to the sub-
stuuce through which the ray pusses ;’' end so on.

In ull these it is quite clear thet Bucen means hy Anioni uo-
thing more then any genernl principle of the lowest degree of
generulity. And in this he is followed by Sir benc Newton,
who gives the title of Axiom to ull “ general experimehtel
Truths”—to the “ Laws of Metion,'’ which ere purely induc-
tiwe, oud not et cll “ eslf-evident” truths—to the principles of
Opties, &c

Whereas, let it he remembered, modern writers strictly
limit the Term to ull “ Laws of Resemblunce'' true of all phe·
nomene clike; independent of Ceusstiou; and so differiug
from such a principle ns thet given ebore, ‘⁶ thet the engle of
.lncidence=the engle of lleflectiou‚’' inosmuch ns this letteris
only true of certeiu special phenomena.

How the Inductiou‚ which ascende by plntforms of “Anime”
stou-ies one over another in regular ordor, can be the seme
