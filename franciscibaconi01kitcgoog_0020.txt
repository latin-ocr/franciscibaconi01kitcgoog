INTRODUCTION. xiii

in the libr-ary ol Usefirl Knowledge‚ vvhich, though scarcely
correct in its divisione ol the work, dic, is still northy os being
consulted. But no student should neglect Dugald Stevmt's
Philosophy ol' the Human Mind. No philosophical writer hes
ever studied Bacon with greater profit: he vves among the lirst
who rsdsed the minda of men, and led them to loolc into Baeon's
writings, and to judge lor themselves, and to profit from them
They whose turn of mind lcads them that vray, vvill find
thot sir Ι. Nevton’s writings are those osa man vvho vas well
acquainted with the mind and phraseology os Baoon. Nor
may ne omit Bp. Butler’s Sermone-a grand application ol
the Inductive principles of ohservation to the study ol' man’s

I mention these worhs, because in the Notos subjoined to

explain and illustrate the meaning of the Author, and to
point out some of the lines ol thought which he suggests;
and this Ι have done specially with a view to those branchos of
education which are chiefly followed at Oxsord. From Ger-
man metaphysicians 1 have taken nothing; partly because I
am hut scantily acquainted with them; but still more because it
does not seem to me that their mind and way of thought have
anything really in common with Bacon's. And I trust that
wherever error may he noticed, allowanoe vvill be mado3 for
a lirst attemptat illustrating so varied and so prolound an
Author must be both defective and liable to mistakes. It is a
matter of astonishment to me that no extensive collection ol'
notes should have hitherto been made on the Novum Orga
non, or indeed on any part of Bucon's writings. Lct me hope

that, having made the attempt, 1 may thereby induce others
to go on with it.

This edition nas undertaken principally at the nequest, and
with the advice of one to vvhom I had hoped to have submitted
