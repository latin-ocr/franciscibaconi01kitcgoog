ΟΝ FORM.

Tne word Idmonis unfortunately one of the most ambiguous
'forms in the English lenguogo. For without roekoning its
applicatione in ordinsry life; its senses ol n torm to sit on, i. e.
e bosnd3 s form in e school, ie. they who sit on the boerd3
form of o limb, i. e. its shepe or figure3 form ol words, i. o.
lixed end unohenging langnsge3 form of applioetion (e mo-
dificetion ol' the lnst); form in (testing, ie. the mould; end
1 dere say thore ere many others3 there am olso several
epplioetions of the Ten-m in philosophioel lnngtmge which ren-
der it extremely difficolt to speok clearly oonoerning it. One
sonmo of confusion we may get rid os direotly. Form, physi-
oelly speaking, is the outwerd, tho visible development ol' any
substenoe; metaphorioelly speaking, it is just the contram it
iewhet one does not see3 itis tho oense of the externel dove-
lopment3 it is tho thing ol' which outwerd ligure is the result3
perhaps only the sign. This is but e rough distinction, end
will require sartho· modilieotion. In the lnnglmge of the
sohools, Form is tho Natura namram,thellet11re whioh pro-
duoes, whiohnosusos substentes to differ ono from onother3
whioh is the egent by whose menno kinds nnd olosses one dis-
tinguished from eeoh other: wherelore forms nne sometimes
oelled “ differentis verns.'' It was this vagno conception oi
the innon· Netos-e which Beoon seized on, md hes mede so pno-
minent in tho Novum Orgsnon. Although his lengusge is by
no means oleon, his “ Form'’ of s Nstme is something fal·
beyond whst we now menn by n “ Len of natum? It meent
the hidden lin (if one moy so speols) ol enoh olnsm its “fons
amnonis? from whioh it flows; whioh elso nlweys grows
with the gnowth3 end (leonenses with the decresse ol the Ne-
tnre, whatever thet Netos-o moy bo. (llos. Org. ll. 1, 4, 13,
15.) At the semo time it is not to he iorgotten, thnt Bnoon
elso expressly states thot he regards ¹‘ Form” ns the seme thing
with ‘⁴ lew? “ Nos eutem, qun de formis loquimur, nil eliud

intelligimus, quom loges illes et determinationes notus pmi,”
